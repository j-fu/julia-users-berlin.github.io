He will gave an introduction on Gaussian Processes and on how can we use them for most supervised problems (regression, classification) in a very efficient way using data augmentation. <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1c5DZlq0rZUyELFPgI4bl0Lw7uUAuDLTHsCE7u-jkZG0/edit?usp=sharing">Here are the slides of his presentation.</a>

Maki-e is a high-performance, extendable, and multi-platform plotting package for Julia. Having mastered many technical challenges for the implementation, he now focuses on making it more user-friendly and your input is highly appreciated.

                  <b>Topic:</b> Lorenzo talked about nonsmooth optimization using proximal algorithms in Julia, in particular his work on the packages <a href="https://github.com/kul-forbes/ProximalOperators.jl">ProximalOperators.jl</a> and <a href="https://github.com/kul-forbes/ProximalAlgorithms.jl">ProximalAlgorithms.jl</a>. The first one implements first order primitives for a variety of functions that can be used to express problems, the second one relies on the first and contains generic implementations of various well-known iterative methods in convex optimization. He also told us of his plans to develop a generic mathematical modelling language for numerical optimisation tasks.

We had a great night, but the reality of organising a regular meet-up with so few members meant that it took another 15 months before the next meeting occured.</br>

      <h3>Inclusiveness statement</h3>
      <p>
          It seems unfortunate to have to make this statement but the computing world is not always know for its inclusivity or diversity.
          We are commited to welcoming anyone who is interested in joining our meet-up and will do our best to learn to communicate with them in a manner which makes them feel a full member of our community without the barriers of rank, background, gender, colour or other distinction.
